# Dander Tours
<hr>
The Murals of West Belfast have become one of the city's main attractions in recent years, so much so that the Murals and asociated tours earned a detailed write up in the latest eidtion of 'Lonely Planets' Guide to Ireland.

Dander tours hopes to be a part of that growing tourism market. Our site is targeted towards younger generations who may not be familiar with the history of 'The Troubles', as well as older generations across Ireland and beyond who may be visting Belfast for the first time.

Through the site, user will be able to get historical overview of Belfasts recent troubled past and gain a better understanding of this history. The user will be able to book a slot on our tour and browse some iconic images of the Troubles.

## Features
<hr>
This site four pages including a home page. Each page has a header which contains nav links to the other pages, as well as a footer that contains social media links.



### Existing Features


**Navigation Bar**

The site uses a navigation bar so that the user can select which page they wish to view. The nav bar remains the same across all pages so the user can cycle effortlessly through the site.

The Gallery page has nine images of that where taken during 'The Troubles'. The images draw the user back to that time and the get a grasp of what the situation was like. The images matched the theme of the whole site.

**The Footer**

Each page has a footer with links to the various popular social media platforms. The footer is simple and effective as the the icons used are instantly recognisable.


**Features left to Implement**

I originally included a reviews section on the sign up page but decided to remove it because It didnt allow for users to add their own reviews to the site.

Ideally the Gallery would have the ability to scroll through the images in a slideshow style view.



## Testing ##
<hr>

The site went through constant testing during implementation to ensure the final product was suitable and free of bugs. I used Google Chromes 'Inspect' feature to ensure that the different portions of the site were both functional and had the desired layout.

The various features of the site all had the desire outcomes - the Nav menu section allowed for the user to cycle effortlessy through the site, the Booking Form had all the relevant inputs and the Responsive media queries ensured that the site had the desired Aesthetic when viewed on small to large screens sizes.
