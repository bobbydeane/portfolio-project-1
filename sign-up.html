                The tour costs Â£5 and it is essential to book early to guarantee your spot! Our tour sets off from the International Wall at Divis street everyday at 11am, from there we take you along the falls road and through the Peace Line to the Loyalist Shankhill road. You will then meet your second local guide who will take you a tour of the Peace lines and local Murals. Don't forget to bring an Umbrella!

                    <em>I've been on a few walking tours and this one is up there with the best. The guides where very informative and funny. A well deserved stew in the local pub after the walk. 5 Stars.</em> - European Bob.
