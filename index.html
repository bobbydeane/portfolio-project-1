                <p>For more than 30 years “The Troubles” have had a powerful impact on the city and its residents. Very few people were unaffected by the violence, and everyone has a tale to tell. 
                    Investigate the real stories beyond the history books with first-hand accounts from those intimately involved. Explore the world’s largest, outdoor art gallery as you examine the many murals, and get the opportunity to sign the Peace Wall and leave your thoughts alongside those of Bill Clinton and the Dalai Lama.
                    </p>
                <p>Venture beyond the guide books and explore Belfast through the political conflict known as “The Troubles.” Walk the streets on both sides of the Peace Line with men and women who have served time in the prisons of Northern Ireland for standing up for their beliefs.
                    Hear stories from both the Republican and Loyalist communities about the effects of the conflict, and get explanations about the political murals that tell the history and culture of the area from a unique perspective.
