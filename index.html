             <p>For more than three decades the “The Troubles” had an immense impact on the residents of Belfast. Few were impacted by the violence, and every community has their own tale to tell. Now you can go beyond the history books and investigate the real stories with first hand accounts from those intimately involved. Explore the world’s largest outdoor art gallery as you examine the many murals, and get the opportunity to sign the Peace Wall and leave your thoughts alongside those of Bill Clinton and the Dalai Lama.
